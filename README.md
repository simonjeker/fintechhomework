## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Robo-advisor / Retirement planning with a focus on educating the clients in the importance of retirement planning and to change how women think about money.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Ellevest is built by women for women, designed with the goal of closing gender money gaps, but it welcomes clients of all gender identities and expressions. However, it specifically focuses on the needs of women: Gender-based investing at Ellevest means factoring women's generally lower incomes, different lifetime earnings curve and longer lifespans into portfolio construction. In addition to this, the company helps its investors to invest in companies that empower positive social change by advancing women. Worth to mention that Ellevest acts as a fiduciary to its clients, looking out for the best interest of each client. Again, mission is to achieve a clients' goal, not beating the market.


* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Wasn't able to find out.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Robo-advisory

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

To handle personal retirement without an actual advisor, through algorithms and machine learning. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Betterment, Cohen and Company, Fortress Investment, Independent women, Schwab etc.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

As a young company with relative small funding compared to its competitors, Ellevest has had a higher year over year growth rate.
By offering a way of reaching someone's financial short and long-term goals, rather than beating the market - strategy and by targeting women, 
specifically addressing their needs it attracts a much larger new client base who had never thought planning their retirement was something they, too could do compared to  the competition. The very thoughtful picking of stocks that are environmentally friendly, 
helping women and minorities etc. is another aspect to consider. How many companies' 401k's are supporting gun manufacturers etc.? People are being presented with a choice.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Success is mesured in the amount of money managed through their clients. -- Based on this metric, Ellevest is far behind from its biggest competitors but catching up.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

 Ellevest is experiencing a high growth rate, catching up to competitors who've been around for far longer as a financial institution with an already long list of clients.  

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I chose this company for many reasons. I am a big believer in educating the clients, giving them as much data as possible and a way of breaking it down into a way a non-pro can understand it.
The company is doing a great job at that, but I believe one could take it a step further by automating sector specific news, social media sentiment, summaries of companies' quarterly reports and announcements in a 
non-overwhelming way to engage the client to become more familiar within its targeted sectors to make better choices in trading by giving them a risk tool.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

By educating and empowering the clients in all levels of personal finances and reducing the fear of actively do something big with their money, a company will keep on growing faster than the competition. There's a huge opportunity 
since most people in their 20's and 30's are far behind when it comes to retirement and life goal planning.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Machine learning
